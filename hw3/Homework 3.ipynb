    "For example, if a BOW model was trained to do sentiment analysis of movie reviews, it would probably classify the following sentence incorrectly: \"That was the opposite of what I would call a good movie\". Unless the model used n-grams of length nine or longer, it would not capture the fact that the word \"opposite\" applies to \"good movie\"."
